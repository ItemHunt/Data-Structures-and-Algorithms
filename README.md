# **Data Structures and Algorithms**

## **Description**
The repository aims to provide useful information to help people understand the subject of **Data Strcutures and Algorithms**. Here you can find commented working implementations of several examples of data structures and algorithms together with learning resources regarding the subject matter. Everything will be written in the Python3 language for the sake of simplicity.
